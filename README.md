        Ekambareswarar Temple (Ekambaranathar Temple) (Kacchi Eakamban Tirukkoyil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva, located in the town of Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, India. 
        It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the five elements, the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, 
        and specifically the element of earth, or Prithvi. Shiva is worshiped as Ekambareswarar or Ekambaranathar or Rajlingeswaram, and is represented by the lingam as Prithvi lingam. 
        His consort Parvati is depicted as Elavarkuzhali.

    <p>
        Temple construction is credited to the Pallava dynasty, who had established their kingdom with Kanchipuram (also known as "Kanchi" or "Shiva Vishnu Kanchi") as the capital city, 
        considered one of the seven sacred cities under Hinduism. In Kanchi, after the Pallavas expanded their territories to the north, west and south both within Tamil, 
        Andhra and Kannada territories under Emperor Narasimhavarman I, they started expanding their capital city of Kanchipuram and built many temples of great magnificence. 
        Among the two unique specimens of temple architecture of the period 640â€“730 CE are the Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram, which is also known as the Vaikunta Perumal temple and the Kailasanathar Temple.
