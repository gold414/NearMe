    <h1>Perumal Temple</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Thiru Parameswara Vinnagaram or Vaikunta Perumal Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the God Vishnu, located in Kanchipuram in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
       Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th through the 9th centuries CE.
       It is one among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to the God Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vaikuntanathan (lit. 'Lord of Vaikunta') and his consort, the Goddess Lakshmi as Sri Vaikundavalli. 
       The temple is considered the second oldest extant temple in Kanchipuram after the Kailasanathar temple.
